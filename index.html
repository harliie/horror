                    <p class="text-faded">Most people love a good haunted house story and it seems that the more lurid it can possibly be, the better.  Everyone has probably been exposed to the typical ghost story involving a haunted house with a terrifying specter that sends residents running out screaming, but, alas, these are just stories…unlike many others.  Putting urban legends and pure speculation aside, there are known occurrences – a plethora of them actually – that involve the paranormal, many of which have been reported for years and have been documented by paranormal investigators.  Stereotypical ghost stories have the tendency to produce a feeling of the far-fetched whenever the word “paranormal” is brought up, but what you’re about to read are not your typical legends and fables.</p>

                        <h3>SCREAMING TUNNEL</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">This one is for those brave hearts boasting hard of their fearless spirits. This is located beneath the railway track that connects Niagara falls to Toronto and New York. As per a legend about a century ago there was a farm house located just near the south entrance of this tunnel. One night the farm house caught fire and a young girl doused in flame screaming for help running wild.Nobody knows the story how the farm house caught fire. She ran through the tunnel if in case she could get some help but alas she was burnt completely and collapsed. So from that day onwards whoever tries lighting a match in the tunnel the spirit comes out screaming and haunting the person till dead. Check out for yourself the truth!</p>

                        <h3>Island of the Dolls, Xochimilco, Mexico</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">In the ‘50s, a man moved to this island in order to be alone, only to find that it was haunted by the spirit of a little girl who drowned here decades before. In an attempt to appease her, he bought countless dolls and hung them from the trees. After a while, he felt that she wasn’t satisfied, and that she wanted him to be a ghost with her. The same day he confessed this fear to a relative, he was found dead, having drowned in the same spot she did years before. Their ghosts can now be seen on the island, and the dolls are said to whisper as you walk past.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">We update dependencies to keep things fresh.Hauntings here have been reported as far back as the 17th century, making this one of the most enduringly haunted places in the world. The Close is composed of a series of underground streets and tunnels that led to various businesses and homes in the 16th and 17th centuries. After plague broke out here it was abandoned, but apparently many spirits of plague victims and past residents still remain. Footsteps that seem to follow close behind are often heard, as well as disembodied voices and various apparitions, including a little girl named Annie.</p>

                        <h3>Monte Cristo - New South Wales, Australia</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">Monte Christo mansion is recalled by travellers as a place which shouldn't even haunt the memories. As per people's version Mrs Crawley the owner of this mansion locked herself up after the death of her husband and never came out in the rest 23 years of her life except for once. She died in there and her spirit lingers in the mansion. Passerby could hear the shrills and weeping of a woman. People who visit the mansion get suffocated as if some spirit is trying to press in them. They get respite of the shackles only when they come out. Instances have also been cited of people turning blue.</p>

                        <h3>Highgate Cemetery - North London, England</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">This is just like watching a horror flick of Alfred Hitchcock in reality. By the time dusk settles down the ultimate horror environment starts to descend on the panorama. Highgate cemetery is one ideal place for ghost hunters. Headless statues, creaky pathways, unmanaged grass pavements and lest we forget the typical hooting of owls is a common feature to be found in this place. High gate cemetery also scores the top slot in being the haunted places in United Kingdom. Still one cannot ignore the Gothic architecture, beautiful serene ambiance and lest we forget the shivery silence which overrules the entire arena!

                        <h3>Changi Beach - Singapore</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">Changi Beach in Singapore is the ultimate one. The Changi beach in Singapore is believed of being a popular killing ground of the Chinese soldiers by the Japanese during the second world war. Thousands of Chinese soldiers were tortured and killed during this operation as they were suspected by the Japanese of getting into anti Japanese activities. This beach stands witness to the killing of innumerable innocent chinese. Till date beach combers thronging to this place could hear the screams and weeping of people. Often at night people could also find deep dig pits as that needed for burials of dead bodies. The most horrifying is that some beach combers have found headless bodies of chinese soldiers on the beach at night.
